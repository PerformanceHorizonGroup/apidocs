# Performance Horizon API
This is the full external API documentation for the [PH](http://performancehorizon.com) API. Every feature exposed to
our clients through our [Web App](https://phgconsole.performancehorizon.com) can be consumed programmatically through
the API. This API documentation is written in [api blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) which can be read by humans
and machines.

The documentation is interactive; calls can be made to all documented endpoints within the browser
without the need to write any code. For devs, there are many tools available to consume the documentation, for more
information check out the [tools section](https://apiblueprint.org/tools.html).

Finally, our API docs are open source. We would welcome any corrections, updates or bug fixes - to do this, please
submit a pull request on our [Github project page](https://github.com/PerformanceHorizonGroup/apidocs).

## Access and Authentication
The API supports two authentication protocols:

1. [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) over HTTPS
2. [Oauth2 via Authorization Code Grant](http://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2/grants/authcode.html) user flow

### HTTP Basic Auth
You must have a valid `application_key` which identifies the Network you are making requests against.

Unless you are creating a User, you should make all requests in the context of a User account. Each User has their own
unique `user_api_key` which must be sent in conjunction with the `application_key`.

- Username: `application_key`
- Password: `user_api_key`

Typically, authentication via HTTP Basic is achieved by sending the `Authorization` header in the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic cDN0ZXcxNDV5M3RhZzQxbjowaHkzNGho
```

Where `cDN0ZXcxNDV5M3RhZzQxbjowaHkzNGho` is the Base64 representation of the username and password:

```
base64(username + ':' + password)
```

## Response Formats
The default response format is `JSON`. You can specify the response format of each request, by adding a file extension
suffix to the end of the request URI. The requested format will dictate the HTTP `Content-Type` header that is returned
in the response. Currently, there are 3 available formats:

| Format               | Header                                   | Notes                                                               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.json`              | `Content-Type: application/json`         |                                                                     |
| `.xml`               | `Content-Type: text/xml`                 |                                                                     |
| `.csv`               | `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` | Only available on specific endpoints                                |

## Compression
The API is compression enabled. To control whether the API response is compressed, send the relevant
`Accept-Encoding` HTTP header:

- Request: `Accept-Encoding: gzip`
- Response: `Content-Encoding: gzip`

## Pagination
Certain endpoints will generate large result sets. To save bandwidth and long processing times, these endpoints will
paginate the results to reduce the strain on both client and server.

Any endpoint that supports pagination will return 3 attributes to support this:

- `offset` the current offset of the data returned
- `limit` the number of results to which the output was restricted
- `count` the total number of results available

If `offset` combined with `limit` is less than the overall `count`, the results have been truncated.
Therefore, to consume all data you will need to page through the result set.

### Paging
To paginate through a result set, you can use a combination of 2 parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                          | Notes                                                               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `offset`             | Offset the results by a given amount | Integer, defaults to `0`                                            |
| `limit`              | Limit the number of results returned | Integer, maximum limit is defined in result set headers             |

For example, if an endpoint produces 500 results, only the first 300 will be returned (results `0` to `299`).
In order to retrieve the remaining results, implement the `offset` GET param. In this example, adding `offset=300` to
the query string parameters.

There are 2 considerations when doing this:

- Results begin at offset `0`. If you're retrieving a report with `limit=300`, page 2 will begin at `offset=300`,
page 3 at `offset=600`, page 4 at `offset=900`, etc.
- The reports you generate are based on live data, and could be subject to continuous, incremental changes. If your
query covers a particularly busy data set, then data inserts or updates may occur between paging.

### Hypermedia
It can be cumbersome to manage pagination programmatically, especially when attempting to rapidly prototype. To provide
some helpful assistance, the API will output a `hypermedia` node for all paginated result sets. Essentially this
performs all necessary calculations and outputs all relevant information with absolute URI's to assist easier pagination.

```
"hypermedia": {
    "pagination": {
        "total_page_count": 15,
        "first_page": "/user.json?limit=100&offset=0",
        "last_page": "/user.json?limit=100&offset=1400",
        "next_page": "/user.json?limit=100&offset=100",
        "previous_page": null
    }
}
```

# Group User

A User is the central entity that all API requests are authenticated against. A User can have permissions against
multiple Publisher and Advertiser accounts.

## User [/user]

Campaigns and dictates which Publishers they accept onto the Campaign to promote their services.

Commissions can be defined at four separate levels, these are:

​
1. Campaign level: these Commissions apply to all Publishers, it is regarded as the base level for all actions that
match the Commission offer.

​2. Group level: Commissions apply to all Publishers in a predefined Commission Group.

​3. Publisher level: Commissions that apply to a specific Publisher.

​4. Voucher Code level: Commissions apply to a specified Voucher Code.

Campaign object.

pending until this decision is made.

An Advertiser must approve or reject all conversion events that occur on their Campaigns. A conversion can have one or more
conversion items, and it is the items which must be updated before they can be Invoiced or ignored. It is possible to
update the status of items individually, or all items within a conversion can be referenced at the same time.
Due to the high volume of processing that can happen on this endpoint, it is Job enabled.

### Update Conversion Events [POST /campaign/{campaign_id}/conversion]

A Conversion update can be actioned against one of 3 references. The relevant reference must be passed, with its
associated id and status. Bulk operations are sent within a `conversions` array. An optional `reject_reason` can
be sent with references that are set to the `rejected` status.

# Group Campaign Tracking

To track conversions on a Campaign, all conversion data must be passed to the PHG tracking API. There are 2
distinct methods of passing this data, via an image/pixel tag (which emulates a HTTP GET), and via a direct API call
(GET or POST). This endpoint is intended as a quick reference to the syntax of the tracking calls, the actual
tracking implementation should be performed in co-operation with the Performance Horizon Integration team.

# Group Job

Some endpoints are extremely data intensive. Rather than force users who interact with the API to implement long
running scripts against these heavy endpoints, the API has a concept of Jobs.

For example, a large Report export request may cover 100,000,000 records, and the generation of this export may be
dependent on a FIFO queue. Therefore it could take several hours before the report is ready. The Job endpoint will
provide instant acknowledgement that a request was received for a significant payload, and will provide details
about the progress of the backgrounded, asynchronous request.

The Job endpoint can be used to periodically request updates on its progress and once finished, it will reference
the location of the final response in its Hypermedia object.

# Group Aggregated Reporting

In most instances, it is not feasible to traverse large paginated result sets - it is a largely inefficient process
when most use cases demand an aggregation of data across a defined time period. To speed up this process the
aggregation endpoint will instantly total all headline stats for a given pivot to offer near instant summation of the
data. These endpoints support the `.csv` format.
