# Group Commission

To further expand on the the `default_commission` specified in the Campaign object, extra Campaign Commission offers
can be created to reward specific actions, products, and types of conversion. An unlimited number of Commissions can
be set up however each Commission offer must be unique. You cannot have 2 active Commissions for the same event.
Commissions can be defined at four separate levels, these are:

​
1. Campaign level: these Commissions apply to all Publishers, it is regarded as the base level for all actions that
match the Commission offer.

​2. Group level: Commissions apply to all Publishers in a predefined Commission Group.

​3. Publisher level: Commissions that apply to a specific Publisher.

​4. Voucher Code level: Commissions apply to a specified Voucher Code.
