# Group Network Publisher

An Advertiser can view all Publishers who are created on their network. This endpoint is not specific to a Campaign,
therefore it pools all available Publishers who have been created or are able to access their Network.
â€‹
It is also possible to accept new Publishers onto the Network, or to reject any approved or pending Publishers
from the Network. If a Publisher is rejected from the Network, they will be automatically rejected from all participating Campaigns.
