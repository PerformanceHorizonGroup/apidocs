# Group Aggregated Reporting

In most instances, it is not feasible to traverse large paginated result sets - it is a largely inefficient process
when most use cases demand an aggregation of data across a defined time period. To speed up this process the
aggregation endpoint will instantly total all headline stats for a given pivot to offer near instant summation of the
data. These endpoints support the `.csv` format.
