# Group User

A User is the central entity that all API requests are authenticated against. A User can have permissions against
multiple Publisher and Advertiser accounts.

## User [/user]

+ Attributes (object)
    + user_id: 11l16829 - ID of the user
    + Include User Base

### Retrieve User [GET]

### Create a User [POST]

This is the only API request which can be made without submitting a HTTP Basic Auth password in the Authorization header.
The reason for this is so that a new User can be created against the requested Network. On success, a unique
`user_api_key` will be returned which can be used in subsequent requests to perform actions as that new User.
