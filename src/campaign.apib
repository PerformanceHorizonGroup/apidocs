# Group Campaign

A Campaign is owned by an Advertiser and an Advertiser may have multiple Campaigns. A Campaign represents an entity
which the Advertiser uses to represent something that they wish to allow Publishers the chance to promote.
A Campaign dictates what products/events/conversions can be promoted, and lets the Publishers understand what
Commission they would earn for generating sales/events/conversions. The Advertiser has complete control over their
Campaigns and dictates which Publishers they accept onto the Campaign to promote their services.
